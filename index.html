              The period in between june to september signifies downpour,it
              brings with it the fragnance of desire. Smoothening winds,lively
              nights discloses flattening mood. It unveils the human
              sensuality.. The long nights fetches with them the boozing breezes
              that are intolerably toxic, the toxicity that unravels inhuman
              urge. And the unexplored ocean beside brings out the very joy in
              exploring the urge.
              <br />
              <br />
              One among those days, A women waits for a bus at a stop, her
              hair's completely wet ,as if it was soaked in a tub of water and
              the dress too got dampened slightly. A tiny droplet trying to
              explore her paving a path from her hair to bottom,got wiped out
              with the woman's very own elegant hands. Her eyes elegant as she
              is. They are in search of something, something that raptures her
              urge that she's been clinging onto for so long. Her very eyes
              symbolises craving ,the very craving for men.
              <br />
              <br />
              Sravani, a 27 year old woman , she works at an exports and imports
              company and is a personal Assistant working at the helper desk
              from morning till evening. Her day starts standing at the bus stop
              for NRT-102 Bus, that drops her at the office.Married and elegant
              ,yet a deficit shadows her life. It is the absence of love..
              <br />
              The bus stop is crowded with men, woman ,children of all ages..Yet
              Sravani searches for the one who provides her, an ample amount of
              what she truly desires for..
              <br />
              A message pops up in the mobile from an unknown number,saying
              "Baby!have you reached the bus stop?". Sravani looks at it with no
              intention of attempting a reply to it. Meanwhile second message
              pops out, "had your husband left you at the stop?". Sravani
              replies to the second one,texting "yes he had and Im at the bus
              stop baby!" . Instant rply flows in from the other end "ok then
              ,take care baby Love you!.".A cheery glow brightens up in
              Sravani's face. She replies immediately acknowledging the love
              from the other person. Then message flows over continuously,,
              Meanwhile the bus she's been waiting for arrives at the stop.And
              she lifts her head in search for a seat from the stop. She at once
              become dumbfounded by seeing a guy , he had stylish looks and his
              anatomy is adorable. he is well build and decent. He has a ear
              ring symbolizing fashion, yet looks decent.
              <br />
              <br />
              Sravani at once leapes through the crowd to get into the bus. She
              makes way through the crowd inside the bus to reach the man she
              has been anticipating for.Yet last, she senses that her long
              lasting thirst will get fullfilled. She reaches out to the
              man,Sanjay. And she irresistably murmurs if she could occupy the
              seat next to him. Sanjay is deeply involved in listening to music
              with his headset and he didn't show any reaction nor give any rply
              to the girl. Sravani out of her insane urge to interact with him
              and her excitement of meeting the man she desired for ,,she
              couldn't resist herself and calls him tapping on his shoulder..
              Without a word uttered from her, sanjay replies immediately,
              "Yes!,Please". The journey begins...
              <br />

              A silent and salient conversation happens among them,, Sravani
              trying to talk and Sanjay completely immersed listening to tunes.
              <br />"Hi",Sravani breaking the ice. <br />"Hello", Sanjay
              soothingly. <br />"So,have we met before somewhere" Sravani
              irrelatbly,yet knowingly. <br />"No,i think..no never",Sanjay
              replying straight away.
              <br />
              "It felt like we have"Sravani as if she was thinking. "anyways Im
              Sravani" Sravani with a bit of relief that she could finally
              introduce herself..
              <br />
              "nice name,Iam Sanjay",Sanjay replies.
              <br />
              "Do you take the same bus daily?" Sravani asks desparately.
              <br />"Yeah,I take this bus only,I get off the bus at my office"
              Sanjay notifies.
              <br />
              "Me too,I take this bus,since i can get off at a stop closer to my
              office" Sravani delightfully.
              <br />"Where do you actually?" Sanjay asks her eagerly.
              <br />
              "I work at Manmadh Export and Imports" Sravani replies and shows
              her id.
              <br />"Really,I also work at the same company" Sanjay excited.
              "And how haven't we meet till now? Oh god" Sravani murmurs
              disappointed. <br />
              "Where do you work actually? I mean the department Sanjay asks
              eagerly. "I work as P.A and i'll be there at the help desk,most
              familiar" Sravani satires. <br />
              "haha, I work at the shipment department ,2 floors below yours"
              Sanjay with a smile. "Anyways it's so nice to meet you" Sravani
              feeling relieved. <br />
              "Same here" Sanjay acknowledging.
              <br />
              Meanwhile a text pops up in Sravani mobile saying, "Have you
              reached the office baby?" . Sravani ignores it and switches off
              her mobile trying not to let anything disturb their conversation.
              <br />
              "And our boss ,he's Yama" Sanjay exclaims.
              <br />
              "he always pokes us,doing things,assigning works everyday ,aah! I
              can't" Sanjay innocently . <br />Saravani listens to his innocence
              , the aroma of his words makes her cling to him.She gets deeply
              rooted with the conversation watching him constantly. <br />
              "One day i'll replace him as the CEO and then you'll be my P.A.
              Will you be?" Sanjay asks her f.
              <br />
              Sravani dwells in the trauma that binds her to him and won't
              respond . "Sravani are you alright?" Sanjay doubtfully.<br />
              "Yeah I will be" Sravani gladly..
              <br />
              <br />
              The bus reaches the company.<br />
              They both gets off the bus talking<br />
              Sravani ,"Will you take the same bus to return?"."Yeah, why?"
              Sanjay<br />
              "nothing ,just." Sravani tries to convey what she's feeling
              indirectly. <br />
              "haa , so you need to take the stairs here" ,Sanjay directs her<br />
              "hmm yeah, and Could you give me your mobile num.." Sravani tries
              to ask his mobile number.<br />
              In the meantime,
              <br />A person shouts at Sanjay saying ,"Sanjay you need to come
              quick".<br />
              "Ok I need to go , anyways nice meeting you" Sanjay leaves .<br />
              Sravani stands still , and she only remembers the tip of the hand
              that touched him. She then takes stairs and makes bills and
              documents but she could only think of his presence. His face
              reverbrates all over her and his words slides through out her.
              <br />
              "Hello ,hello madam ", A person shouts from behind tapping over
              her shoulder..
              <br />
              Sravani turns back and she could see his face and only his face
              over everbody.<br />
              "hello Sravani ! hello" Sanjay call her Shouting.
              <br />
              Sravani could only hear someone mumbling and she realizes it's him
              <br />
              "Ohh ,hey hi" Sravani replies Surprised.
              <br />
              "Sir , ask me to set these papers , Where should I?." Sanjay
              incompletedly <br />
              "Yeah, put them in the drawer in sir's office" Sravani relies .<br />
              "Thank you " He acknowledges .
              <br />
              she could watch him through the door,and she loves his innocence
              of keeping the records organised, She just remembers his every
              action and his feats in achieving it.
              <br />
              Meanwhile ,
              <br />
              A message pop ups ,"Is everything fine there baby?" from the
              unknown.<br />
              Sravani warmly,"Haa baby!, missing you badly."<br />
              "Don't worry, We'll catch up sometime", From the unknown.<br />
              She involves herself in completing her works and the clock ticks 4
              .
              <br />
              She immediately packs everything and descends the steps to 1st
              floor
              <br />
              "Is Sanjay here?",Sravani Asks desparately<br />
              "Sanjay ? No he just left now" Watch head informs her.<br />
              Sravani ,then descends the steps and peeps out through the window
              . She finds Sanjay taking the bus
              <br />
              She descends the stairs
              <br />
              "hey stop ,," She shouts after the bus.
              <br />
              inspite of her shouting , the bus leaves ,,
              <br />
              Sravani stands there,,still hoping that they would take the same
              bus ,sitting beside, and chatting , exploring the unexplored . She
              now got deeply rooted with his presence ,and had an ultimate
              craving to be with him ..
              <br />
              A message pops up ,"Had your husband picked you up, baby?" unknown
              <br />
              "No baby!" Sravani replies distressed.
              <br />
              "Can I pick You?We'll have great time." unknown guileful .
              <br />
              "Yeah sure.." Sravani with a simple yet deprived smile.

              A bit deprived and a bit joyfull.. 
              Deprivation from the thought that the man she desired has left her and a bit of joy from the thought she could meet the one 
              who meant everything for her.. 
              A naughty breeze blows touching her right cheek,,it has left with her the scent of the man she wanted to be with.. 
              The atmosphere around rises her agitation of being with him ,She at once could only think of him ,,his pictures ,his words and his essence
              couldn't leave her.. 
              Sravani looks at her mobile,,and the chat's been left open,,it show's the unknown been typing ... 
              <br>
              Sravani didn't want this essence , leave her alone.she want to float in those memories, embrace every deepest thought she could get with Sanjay....thus she decides..<br>
              She at once texts the unknown,"Baby! ,I want to ride alone today.."
              <br>
              Unknown watches the text and replies ,"haa ok baby!,sure but be carefull!".
              <br>
              Sravani with a bit of relief , She sighs.. 
              <br>
              Sravani takes an auto and she sails in it and with it through her deepest desires with the man she really love to be with.. 
              She is so desparate and halucinates things around her with him,,she feels everything happening with her real though it isn't. 
              <br>
              She reaches her Apartment.She climbs the stairs in trance.. 
              While she is about to open the door.. 
              <br>
              "Sravani,You left the milk packet outside this morning...Sravani,,Sravani...",Neighbour calls her 
              <br>
              But she was with no choice but to be in her obbsessive urge...She at once closes the door and enters..
              <br>
              She places the company files and her bag on the drawing table ,,she could see her husband reading a newspaper on a swing with his back facing her.. 
              <br>
              And that is his favourite part..He spends most of his time in the balcony on th swing exploring the very beauty of the city.. 
              Sravni though married,,she hadn't had the life she deserved..
              <br>
              With an ignorant husband,,she never had what she desired for and she never had what she loved.. 
              <br>
              Like a broken and an ignorant twig,she's waiting for her chances to get an aid..
              An aid that shades her like the canophy and an aid that liberates her from the this doomed canophy..
              <br>
              She at once grabs the oppurtunity and she goes into her room and locks it down...She searches for a thing that lets her relieve from the mass of desire that she had held till home.. 
              Sravani looks over every desk and she dusted few .. Atlast she found the thing... 
              It is a diary ,she's fond of writing everything that escalates her urge..
              She starts describing every inch of the day that happened..She gets immensely involved in it ,,she loves writing about Sanjay.. 
              She dives into the world of writing her novel of love.. 
              <br>
              Meanwhile..
              <br>
              Her husband knocks on the door ,shouting "shall we have supper??"
              <br>
              Sravani immediately closes the diary with hesitation,"coming!!!"
              She closes the diary writing,"So Eager to meet you Sanjay..."
              She gets ready to sleep and a message pops up,"Have reached home safe baby!"from the unkown.
              <br>
              Sravani replies saying,"haa baby! and sorry for disturbing your plans"
              <br>
              "Not a problem Baby! I always wanted you to be happy ,i consider your will to do things first" from the unkown with concern..

              She reaches the bus stop and waits eagerly for the bus NRT-102..
              Out of her insane urge and will , it arrives 5 mins early..

              "Is it ok for you ",Sanjay doubtfully.

              Sravani long awaiting for this very oppurtunity,"sure ,after office". 
              <br>
              "Yes,Ok then",Sanjay excited
              <br>
              They both reaches their office and indulges in their respective works.. 
              Sravani though completely immersed ,she feels anxious about her past,,she gets flashes of memories full of anguish.
              <br>
              she tries to get rid off them but she calms herself a bit .. 
              <br>
              And she diverts herself into the mood ,the mood of happiness that she will be experiencing in a moment or two...
              <br>
              And the time comes as well... 
              <br>
              They both descends the steps,,Sravani notices his every mumble, his every move ,she gets caught by his expressive eyes,,
              those that contains immense meaning..she stares at his marvells
              <br>
              They comes out of the office premises and both stares at each other...
              <br>
              "where shall we go?",Sanjay asks breaking the ice.. 
              <br>
              "If you dont mind, I would recommed a place , I love being at beach shore",Sanjana doubtfully.. 
              <br>
              "sure we'll go,is it your favourite or what",Sanjay asks her desparetly 
              <br>
              "Yes it is",Sravani murmurs.. 
              <br>
              Yet it is the place she had most reviting memories of her life, It is her most happiest and the most nostalgic location.. 
              She could only think of happiness in bounds when she's at beach shore..
              <br>
              And now she wanted to share the space with him... 
              <br>
              They both walks along the sea shore talking all the while..The breeze around compells Sravani to putforth the thing that she's been hardly trying to hide.. 
              She shares with him every inch of her memory that she had at that place...
              <br>
              Meanwhile 
              <br>
              A foodtruck caughts her eye,,she likes pav bhaji there 
              <br>

              "I used to eat here every now and then ,It's is the best",Sravani explains Sanjay 
              <br>
              Sravani looks at Sanjay for his response
              <br>

              <br>
              "This is the place",Sanjay points to the place with his hand
              <br>
              Sravani turns to have a look at that place
              It is T-road junction..It has a street lamp in middle and 3 roads meeting ...and is deserted 
              <br>
              "I don't want to be here, and I need to go".Sravani at once exclaims 
              <br>
              Sravani hurries from the place ,she could get flashes of dreadful past..her ears contains echoes of furious past.. 
              All the past at once reverberates through her body and she couldn't contain it to herself..

              "What happened,why are you leaving",Sanjay trying to stop her from leaving 
              <br>
              "listen , I'll drop you",Sanjay tapping on her shoulder

              "Don't touch me",Sravani burts out of her greef.. 
              <br>
              The environment around brings with it a fearfull roar , whooshing winds,everything around becomes gloomy and it starts raining..
              <br>
              Sravani leaves from there taking an auto..
              <br>
              She sits in the auto and starts wheeping all around..she never tried to recollect her past and never wanted tooo.. 
              Meanwhile.. 
              <br>
